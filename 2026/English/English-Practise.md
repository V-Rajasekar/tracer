Day-1

The answers marked "Wrong!" are ungrammatical for standard English in those specific sentences.

## Sentence 6: “I couldn’t find his house. I ....................... a map.”

Options:  
- don’t have  
- didn’t have  
- hadn’t  

- The first sentence is in the **past**: "couldn't find".
- "don't have" is present tense, so it does not match the past context → incorrect.
- "hadn't" must be followed by a past participle ("hadn't brought / had not had"), so "I hadn't a map" is not natural/standard modern English → incorrect.
- "didn't have" correctly matches the past time of "couldn't find" → correct.

## Sentence 11: “I went out .......................... money.”

Options:  
- without some  
- without any  
- without no  

- After a negative-like word such as **without**, English normally uses **any**, not **some**, so "without some money" is not natural in this general statement.
- "without no money" is a double negative in standard English (equivalent to "without any money at all" in some dialects) and is considered incorrect in standard grammar.
- "without any money" is the standard, grammatically correct form → correct.

## Sentence 12: “Have you got ......................... luggage?”

Options:  
- much  
- many  
- some  

- "Luggage" is an **uncountable** noun.
- With uncountable nouns, "much" is used in questions and negatives, "many" is for plural countable nouns, and "some" is more for offers/requests or positive statements.
- Here, a neutral question about quantity uses "much luggage?" → "Have you got much luggage?" is correct; "many luggage" is wrong because "luggage" is not countable, and "some luggage" is not the pattern the exercise is testing.

Here is why each selected “Wrong!” option is incorrect, and why the answer key choice is better. [englishgrammar](https://www.englishgrammar.org/modal-verbs-exercise-for-class-10/)

## Sentence 2  
She ............................ awake. There is no light in her room. [englishgrammar](https://www.englishgrammar.org/modal-verbs-exercise-for-class-10/)

- Wrong choice: **shouldn't be**  
  - Meaning: It is not a good idea for her to be awake (advice).  
  - Problem: The sentence is not giving advice; it is making a logical conclusion from evidence (no light).  

- Correct: **can’t be (cannot be)**  
  - Meaning: It is (almost) impossible that she is awake.  
  - Reason: From the fact “no light in her room,” the speaker concludes it is impossible she is awake. [englishgrammar](https://www.englishgrammar.org/modal-verbs-exercise-for-class-10/)

## Sentence 5  
Visitors .......................... not feed or tease zoo animals. [englishgrammar](https://www.englishgrammar.org/modal-verbs-exercise-for-class-10/)

- Wrong idea: “Either could be used here” (must / should)  
  - **Must not** = it is forbidden by rules/law, very strong prohibition.  
  - **Should not** = it is a bad idea / not advisable.  

- Given answer: **should not**  
  - The site treats this as advice rather than a strict law: it is not a good idea to feed or tease animals. [englishgrammar](https://www.englishgrammar.org/modal-verbs-exercise-for-class-10/)

## Sentence 6  
There is something under the bed. It ............................ a mouse. [englishgrammar](https://www.englishgrammar.org/modal-verbs-exercise-for-class-10/)

- Wrong choice: **All of these** (may be / might be / could be)  
  - In general English, all three can express possibility, but the exercise wants **one** answer.  

- Correct: **could be**  
  - “Could be” is often used for a realistic possibility when you have some evidence (you see something under the bed). [englishgrammar](https://www.englishgrammar.org/modal-verbs-exercise-for-class-10/)

## Sentence 7  
If he had replied to my letter, it ........................... days ago. [englishgrammar](https://www.englishgrammar.org/modal-verbs-exercise-for-class-10/)

- Wrong choice: **should be arriving / should arrive**  
  - Both refer to present or future time, not to a result that is already in the past.  

- Correct: **should have arrived**  
  - Refers to a past result that was expected but did not happen: the letter is not here now, but it was expected some days ago. [englishgrammar](https://www.englishgrammar.org/modal-verbs-exercise-for-class-10/)

## Sentence 12  
If she left school at 4, she ............................. be here in half an hour. [englishgrammar](https://www.englishgrammar.org/modal-verbs-exercise-for-class-10/)

- Wrong choices: **would / shall**  
  - **Would be**: more for unreal/imaginary conditions, or polite requests.  
  - **Shall be**: formal promise or offer, not natural in this context.  

- Correct: **should be**  
  - Meaning: It is reasonable to expect she will be here in half an hour (logical expectation based on the condition). [englishgrammar](https://www.englishgrammar.org/modal-verbs-exercise-for-class-10/)

If you tell which option you chose for each of these, a very short reason can be given for your exact mistake in each sentence.
