## How to use this path

- **Start** with Beginner → General grammar, then move to verbs, tenses, and prepositions; aim for 2–3 exercises per session. [englishgrammar](https://www.englishgrammar.org/exercises/)
- **Progress** to Intermediate mixed grammar, then choose one “focus” area per week (tenses, modals, conditionals) using the relevant group above. [englishgrammar](https://www.englishgrammar.org/exercises/)
- **Finish** with Advanced exercises once intermediate feels comfortable, using the advanced tense and connector sets as a final polish. [englishgrammar](https://www.englishgrammar.org/exercises/)

On englishgrammar.org there are several focused practice pages for commas and semicolons, plus some related material on punctuation with independent clauses; there does not appear to be a single exercise that covers comma, semicolon, dash and “etc.” together in one quiz. [englishgrammar](https://www.englishgrammar.org/semicolon-colon-interrogation-mark/)

## Comma practice

- **Comma – usage and examples**  
  Explains the main uses of the comma (lists, clauses, etc.) with practice questions.  
  https://www.englishgrammar.org/comma/ [englishgrammar](https://www.englishgrammar.org/comma/)

- **Punctuation marks with independent clauses**  
  Shows how to punctuate independent clauses with full stop, comma + conjunction, and semicolon; good for comma vs semicolon decisions.  
  https://www.englishgrammar.org/punctuation-marks-independent-clauses/ [englishgrammar](https://www.englishgrammar.org/punctuation-marks-independent-clauses/)

## Semicolon practice

- **Semicolon, Colon and Interrogation mark**  
  Explains the semicolon and colon with examples and short practice items.  
  https://www.englishgrammar.org/semicolon-colon-interrogation-mark/ [englishgrammar](https://www.englishgrammar.org/semicolon-colon-interrogation-mark/)

- **Semicolon before a transitional phrase**  
  Focuses on using a semicolon before words like however, therefore, nevertheless, etc.  
  https://www.englishgrammar.org/semicolon-transitional-phrase/ [englishgrammar](https://www.englishgrammar.org/semicolon-transitional-phrase/)

- **Using semicolon with transitional adverbs**  
  Similar focus on semicolons plus transitional adverbs between clauses.  
  https://www.englishgrammar.org/semicolon-transitional-adverbs/ [englishgrammar](https://www.englishgrammar.org/semicolon-transitional-adverbs/)

## For dashes and “etc.”

englishgrammar.org has explanation articles on punctuation, but dedicated dash or “etc.” exercises are less prominent; for detailed contrast of semicolon, colon and dash you can also use this external practice/explanation page:  
https://www.grammarly.com/blog/punctuation-capitalization/semicolon-vs-colon-vs-dash/ [grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/punctuation-capitalization/semicolon-vs-colon-vs-dash/)

If you like, the next step can be a mini practice set created just for you that mixes comma, semicolon and dash in one custom exercise.
